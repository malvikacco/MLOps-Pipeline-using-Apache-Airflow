# MLOps-Pipeline-using-Apache-Airflow

--> Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) integrates machine learning model development and deployment into a robust, automated pipeline. 

--> The goal of this pipeline is to streamline the process of analyzing screentime data by automating its preprocessing and utilizing machine learning to predict app usage. To ensure seamless execution, we will design an Airflow DAG to schedule and automate daily data preprocessing tasks to support a robust and scalable workflow.
